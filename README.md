## Credits
I give credit to https://github.com/Anka-S/hata-na-tata. I was inspired by their work and the layout was very similar to what i wanted to use myself.
I have used their code as a template and changed bits to meet what i need. Some bits of code are still the same, But with future updates i plan to change the code to fit better with my project and the features.

I give credit to Code Institute for helping me through this journey and for giving me code i have used from the LMS Django walkthrough. Thank you to all the facilitators for being there to help too.

I must also credit Mars Oakley and Guy Steele-Perkins from my WECA Boootcamp program for helping me to understand some issues such as merging.
